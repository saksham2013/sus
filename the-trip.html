    <h1>The Trip</h1>
    
    <h2>Day one</h2> 
    <p>This road trip was planned by my family, Trinabh’s family, and Evan’s family  for Thanksgiving break. They booked a fifteen seater van so all of us can ride together and have fun!</p>
    
    <p>One dark night I awoke to my dad saying “Wake up, Wake up! It is time to go!” and suddenly I remembered….THE TRIP!!! I got out of bed and got ready, and went to the van. It also was pretty cold, but soon I adjusted. We then picked up all our family friends, and started our road trip! There were 11 of us and a cute dog named Biti. For me it was a bit hard to sleep but eventually I drifted off to slumber.
Soon about 8:00 am me and my friends woke up. We then stopped at a rest area for breakfast. We ate Hide-and-seek chocolate crackers, bread with nutella and bread, and chocolate milk. While we were eating, the Fifa world cup was streaming live so we were able to watch it! We continued our road trip, and talked on the way to lunch. We soon reached McDonalds and ate lunch there!</p>
    
    <p>At around 5:00 pm we reached our Airbnb in Flagstaff, Arizona. We had lots of fun claiming our room and playing around! At 6:00 pm me, Trinabh, Evan, and Briana we all relaxed in the hot tub for 30 minutes then we showered 2 at a time. After a few minutes we ate dinner of rice and chicken. After an hour of eating we played video games and slept.</p>
    
    <h2>Day two</h2>    
    <p>So the moment we woke up we talked for a little bit till Briana called us to come down and eat breakfast. While we were eating we also were watching the World cup on Fox News. After 50 minutes of watching we all drove to Slide Rock State Park and hiked there for a little bit. Once we reached the end of the trail there was a beautiful river and rocks. So we played for an hour. Then we hiked up and drove to our next stop, Chapel of the Holy Cross. The place was a peaceful cristian church and had strange rock formations.We took family pictures and even went inside the church! Inside the church there was a statue of Christ tied to a tree. That is apparently how he died. It also was my first time seeing all of this so I was excited! Then we ate lunch at a fine restaurant called Sedona Pizza and Pasta. Of course we ate pizza and pasta for lunch. Once we finished eating we drove to Devie’s Bridge. Me, my dad, Trinabh, and Evan then hiked ¾ of the way to Devie’s bridge but it got too dark so we ran back to the van when the rest of the group was sitting is waiting. We then drove back to the airbnb and played video games and slept.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>The moment we woke up we talked till we got hungry and ate breakfast. While we were eating, the parents were packing our bags to check out of our airbnb. Once we checked out we started driving to Antelope Canyon x!!!! As the text says, I was very excited!!! Once we reached we hired a tour guide to show us the way. And they drove us to the main canyon in their 4x4 minivan. Soon once the van stopped we hiked down into our first stop on the canyon. After that we played and walked down the canyon that used to be filled with water. Once the tour finished we hiked up and went back to our hotel. We played video games till midnight and slept.</p>
  <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <p>We woke up and ate breakfast while talking, the breakfast was eggs, bacon, and muffins.
 Then we drove to Glen Canyon dam. We played with rocks and took pictures. Then we went to our next stop, Horseshoe Bend!!! We ran around, hiked, took pictures, and made paper airplanes!!</p>
